# React Express
ReactExpress is a project that involves a coordination of two seperate running frameworks; Express.js for backend and React for client front-end. Code for Express.js is focused into this repository and you can find the React applications in [ReactExpressClient](https://github.com/DevCharlesJ/ReactExpressClient). Although the goal is to use single server routing to handle the client applications, the `config.js` file has been set aside to support individual server/client applications where preferred.

## ChatApp application
ChatApp is the first miniture app to be added in the portfolio. The purpose of this application is to simulate an online messaging experience available on the web. The plan is to continously refine the app in a way that brings it closer to the standard messaging app.
